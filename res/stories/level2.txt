Each level deepens the paradox. Walls melt into static; paths rewrite themselves mid-step. Strange glyphs pulse on stones—“Simulation Error”—as if the world glitches. Enemies emerge: faceless drones, phantom hunters, illusions mimicking your form. You collect scattered Memory Fragments, each revealing cryptic visions—a lab, a shadowy figure, a machine humming. But clarity slips away like sand. Who built this maze? Why you?
